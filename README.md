# 🌌 Plutonic 🌌

Plutonic is an asynchronous algorithmic trading framework written in 🦀*Rust*🦀. Users can implement their own trading strategies and register it with Plutonic to automatically execute. Plutonic interfaces with [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/).

## Why make Plutonic?

I have no desire to use this bot in an attempt to make money and only want to use it for paper trading. I see value in learning how to create a full stack application. I also have interests in Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence and I hope to one day use various models in Putonic.
