# ðŸŒŒ Plutonic ðŸŒŒ

Plutonic is a stock trading bot written in ðŸ¦€*Rust*ðŸ¦€. This bot is asynchronous and utilizes tokio.

## How is Plutonic Made?

To create Plutonic, I am using [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and it's corresponding [apca](https://crates.io/crates/apca) to access all of Alpaca's services.

## Why make Plutonic?

I have no desire to use this bot in an attempt to make money and only want to use it for paper trading. I see value in learning how to create a full stack application. I also have interests in Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence and I hope to one day use various models in Putonic.

## How to Contribute?

While I create the initial infrastructure of Plutonic, I will not be accepting any sort of pull requests. I believe it is best for my learning experience to have to implement the core logic myself.
