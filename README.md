# ðŸŒŒ Plutonic ðŸŒŒ

Plutonic is a stock trading bot written in python. It will be operable through a web interface or via the command line. While this project will purely be written in python for now, the future plan is for the core of the bot to be written in a systems level language for better runtime performance.

# How is Plutonic Made?

To create Plutonic, I am using [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and it's corresponding [Alpaca-py](https://alpaca.markets/docs/python-sdk/index.html) to access all of Alpaca's services.

## Why make Plutonic?

I have no desire to use this bot in an attempt to make money and only want to use it for paper trading. I see value in learning how to create a full stack application. I also have interests in Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence and I hope to one day use various models in Putonic.

## How to Contribute?

While I create the initial infrastructure of Plutonic, I will not be accepting any sort of pull requests. I will be using [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=What%20is%20Gitflow%3F,lived%20branches%20and%20larger%20commits.) throughout the development process and that will be expected if I were to open this to contributions.
